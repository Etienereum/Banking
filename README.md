INTRODUCTION

1.1 INTERNET BANKING
Banks have traditionally been in the forefront of harnessing technology to improve their products, services and efficiency. They have, over a long time, been using electronic and telecommunication networks for delivering a wide range of value added products and services. The delivery channels include direct dial – up connections, private networks, public networks etc and the devices include telephone, Personal Computers including the Automated Teller Machines, etc. With the popularity of PCs, easy access to Internet and World Wide Web (WWW), Internet is increasingly used by banks as a channel for receiving instructions and delivering their products and services to their customers. This form of banking is generally referred to as Internet Banking, although the range of products and services offered by different banks vary widely both in their content and sophistication.

1.2 WHAT IS JAVA

JAVA is a high level programming language which evolved from the earlier versions like C++.The Java programming language consists out of a Java compiler, the Java virtual machine, and the Java class libraries. The Java virtual machine (JVM) is a software implementation of a computer that executes programs like a real machine.The Java compiler translates Java coding into so-called byte-code. The Java virtual machine interprets this byte-code and runs the program.The Java virtual machine is written specifically for a specific operating system.The Java runtime environment (JRE) consists of the JVM and the Java class libraries. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems.
Java has the following properties:
•	Platform independent
•	Object-orientated programming language
•	Strongly-typed programming language
•	Interpreted and compiled language
•	Automatic memory management.
